# Neural_Network_in_CPP
Implementation of stochastic gradient descent as part of COV880 to classify hand written digits. The code serves as a template for any general neural network. Tweak the global variables in neralnetwork.cpp and the arguments given in main.cpp to suit the network according to your needs.
Uses OpenMP to parallelize code for MatrixMultiply.
